This project follows the proposal of the activity ["Project: Landing Page" for the website The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), where we should create a basic landing page with free content to choose from, using basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and positioning using flexbox. Two files are available for this activity, the webpage template and a style guide with the colors and fonts used, but leaving it free for modifications.

As they left free for changes in design, colors, photos and content, I decided to make my dog Ulrich's landing page, "ulrich.doxie".

As it is my first time creating a page from scratch, I had some difficulties with how to start, the basic structure of the page, choosing the semantically correct tags, how to name these tags using the BEM methodology (a subject that I advanced a little in relation to the course) and, of course, flexbox positioning I'm still absorbing the concepts.

The webpage is not responsive, designed for web browsers only.
